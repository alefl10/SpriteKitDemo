# Description

Repository dedicated to learn and practice how to get started on developing iOS native Applications using Swift-based SpriteKit framework. The XCode project included in the repository is part of an academic assignment which shows simple, powerful and useful features of SpriteKit employed in the creation of iOS Game Applications. Furthermore, it includes a PowerPoint presentation which, along with this README, provides essential and practical information about said framework and 2D-Game Apps for native iOS environments.


## Getting Started

- **SpriteKite** is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure that you can use to animate arbitrary textured images, otherwise known as sprites

- **Tutorials and Documentation**
  - <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit>
  - <https://www.raywenderlich.com/42699/spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners>
  - <http://www.sprite-kit.com/>
  
  
 ## SpriteKitDemo Game App
 
 - This project includes a Game Application that includes main SpriteKit features such as
  - **SKNode**
  - **SKView**
  - **SKScene**
  - **SKTransition**
  - **SKSpriteNode**
  
- A combination of both a visual and a programmatic approach was employed in the design and development of this project. This allowed to include and show a rich variety of tools, aspects, and elements that made the project and the game itself more complete in terms of learning/teaching purposes.
 
- **This Game Application does not intendt to show a full version of a real game but rather to lay out the path for SpriteKit beginners to get started on a hands-on project. Its main goal is to serve as a tutorial**


## Additional Info

It is assumed you have basic understanding of the following

- Swift
- XCode

For the Game Application to work properly, it is assumed you have already installed the following on your Macintosh machine:

- XCode 9.2 or superior
- Swift 3
